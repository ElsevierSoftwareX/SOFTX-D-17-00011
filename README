The compuGUT platform for in silico simulation of intestinal fermentation is an
open source tool written in C. Compilation of the source (access to advanced
options) requires libraries developed by the Lawrence Livermore National 
Library (SUNDIALS), specifically the non-linear solver (KINSOL) and ODE solver 
(CVODES). Binaries generated in 64-bit Linux using intel and gnu compilers, and
32-bit linux using the gnu compiler are also provided and may be suitable for 
some users. Instructions for building from source are provided in this document. 
Details about the operation of the compuGUT are found in the software technical 
documentation - Moorthy & Eberl (2015)

Version 1 Details:
- simulate a model system with primary substrate of fiber, nine subsequent 
substrates/metabolites, four biomass functional groups with up to ten 
subdivisions per group.
- physical analogous is a cylindrical pipe with a fluid media through the 
center of the pipe (lumen) and fixed medium of constant volume attached to 
the pipeâ€™s inner wall (mucus). Components are exchanged between media and 
removed from the system either through the mucus (in to the host) or at the 
end of the pipe.
- exchange parameters are defined spatially along the length of the pipe. 
Digestion parameters are constant in both lumen and mucus environments.
- dietary input (fiber, bacteria) is prescribed at every hour for a minimum 
of 24 hours up to a maximum of 365 days. Simulations longer than diet input 
prescription assume repeated cycling of diet.
- software developed in a Linux computing environment. Primary tool written 
in C, with auxiliary scripts written in R and BASH (LINUX).
- functional coding and modeling strategy promotes continuous adaptation, 
extension and improvement.

Upcoming versions:
v02 - mixed diet input
v03 - antimicrobial activity (as antibiotic or other chemical agent)

Dependencies: 
-cvODE-2.7.0
-KINSOL-2.7.0

BUILDING FROM SOURCE:
1) Download compressed latest version of compuGUT from 
   project url: compugut.sourceforge.net
2) Navigate to the download location and uncompress
   compuGUT. For example, if the latest version was "compuGUT-v01.tar" 

   $ tar -xf compuGUT-v01.tar

3) Navigate to uncompressed folder. For example, if the uncompressed
   folder was "compuGUT-v01":

   $ cd compuGUT-v01

4) Change permissions of 'quick-compile-X.sh' script to 
   executable, where X is either 32 or 64 depending on your system.

   $ chmod 744 quick-compile-X.sh

5) Run quick-compile-X.sh script to generate compuGUTv01-lXg
   binary, where X is either 32 or 64, and 'l' and 'g'
   indicate that the binary is functional on linux operating
   systems and was compiled using a gnu compiler (gcc). 

   $ ./quick-compile-X.sh


EXECUTING BINARY:
    Users can also use the pre-compiled binary if relevant.

    $ ./compuGUTv01-l64g

    32-bit binaries will be provided upon request. (Contact Arun Moorthy)

INTERACTIVE R-Scripts:
    R-scripts change more frequently than c source code so documentation
    is provided within the scripts. Many additional packages are required 
    as noted in the scripts themselves.
