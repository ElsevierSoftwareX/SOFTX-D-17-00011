# Anaerobic Digestion of Fiber Process summary:
#
#
# Complex carbohydrates are HYDROLYZED to monomer sugars, which is then
# converted into (1) lactate and (2) three short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs - acetate,
# proprionate, butyrate) through ACIDOGENESIS (lactate is also further
# converted to SCFAs). The SCFAs  are then converted to acetate through
# ACETOGENESIS or methane through METHANOGENESIS. 
#
# Hydrolysis is accomplished using enzymes that are thought to be produced by
# sugard degrading bacteria because the sugar degrading bacteria gain
# immediate benefit from the production of monomer sugar.
#
# The conversion of monomer sugar is accomplished directly by sugar degrading
# bacteria (SD Bacteria). 
#
# The conversion of lactate is accomplished directly by lactate degrading
# bacteria (LD Bacteria).
#
# The conversion of SCFAs to acetate is accomplished by Hydrogen Degrading
# Acetogens (HDA), and the conversion of SCFAs to methane is accomplished by
# Hydrogen Degrading Methanogens (HDM).
#
# These four bacterial groups will eventually die/decay and become a complex
# carbohydrate. 
#
# As such, the anaerobic digestion of carbohydrate is a system of 9 processes
# 1) Hydrolysis
# 2) Glucose Utilization
# 3) Lactate Utilization
# 4) Acidogenesis
# 5) Methanogenesis
# 6) Death of SD Bacteria
# 7) Death of LD Bacteria
# 8) Death of HDA
# 9) Death of HDM
#
# With each process having associated YIELDS of other components, and KINETIC
# RATES (specific growth, half saturation, etc). These parameters are defined below.
